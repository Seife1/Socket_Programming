# Socket Programming
## A client-server socket programming over TCP
	The program utilizes a TCP/IP protocol to establish a connection between the client and server. The server listens for incoming connections from clients, while the client initiates the connection by sending a request to the server. Once connected, data can be exchanged between the two parties in real-time. The data transmitted or exchanged between client and server is in text format. A socket is a communication endpoint that serves as a link between two machines on a network. It has a port number, which the TCP layer can use to identify the application that receives the data. An endpoint usually includes a port number and an IP address.
	This socket programming uses python programming language. Python has a built-in socket module that provides low-level network communication functionality. The socket module allows you to create and use sockets in Python programs, and provides functions for creating, connecting, accepting, sending, and receiving data through sockets.
